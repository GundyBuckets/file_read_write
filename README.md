# Overview

This is my first Rust program that I wrote to learn more about this language and grow my knowledge to become a software engineer.

This basic file I/O program has the basic to write to a file named example.txt. It can write, read, append, delete, and give you the size of the file.

I wrote this program as a starting point as I try to branch out to other languages than just Python and C#
